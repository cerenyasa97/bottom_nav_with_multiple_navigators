## Description
In this project, a big problem of Bottom Navigation Bar widget of Android was solved. If another tab is selected when you navigate the app to other pages in the selected tab, the navigation stack of the previous tab will be deleted, and you could not return to the last page of the first tab. To prevent this problem, A Custom Bottom Navigation widget is created. In this widget, there is a navigation stack of every tab, and thus the state of each tab is preserved.
